# Handwriting Recognition Math Equation Solver with CNN
It is an interactive web application allowing users to solve mathematical equations by submitting images containing handwritten equations (mathematical numbers and symbols). The application uses CNN specifically trained for solving mathematical equations.
The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to write their handwritten equations, submit them as images, and get the calculated solutions back.

# Dataset
The symbol recognition model is trained using Kaggle's handwritten symbol dataset.
